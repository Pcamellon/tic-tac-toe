# Dragons vs Unicorns

## Overview

Welcome to a magical world where Dragons and Unicorns bring a fresh twist to classic Tic-Tac-Toe! This project showcases a fun, interactive web-based game where mythical creatures battle for supremacy on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbols (Dragons or Unicorns) on the board, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game features an AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm, providing a challenging single-player experience.

This is a small demo project where I wanted to embed some AI magic into a simple game for fun. While exploring minimax algorithms and game theory, I thought it would be more engaging to replace the traditional X's and O's with magical creatures. Feel free to fork the repository and create your own version. If you have any questions, please reach out to me via email.

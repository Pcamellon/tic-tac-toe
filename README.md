# Dragons vs Unicorns: A Tic-Tac-Toe Adventure

Welcome to Dragons vs Unicorns, an enchanting twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project showcases a fun, interactive web-based game where mythical creatures battle for supremacy on a 3x3 grid.

## About the Game

Dragons vs Unicorns is a two-player turn-based game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbols (Dragons or Unicorns) on the board, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game features an AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm, providing a challenging single-player experience.
